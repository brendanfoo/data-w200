    "2. Polymorphism: No. There is no demonstration of polymorphism since there is only one method. A demonstration of polymorphism would be multiple methods having the same name but different parameters to distinguish themselves from one another.\n",
    "3. Object-Oriented programming: Yes. OOP uses classes and objects to input properties and behaviors into individual objects. Here, we have the class Cart where we can create a Cart object with its innit method and its own instance method add_to_cart.\n",
    "4. Top-down design: Yes. There is a demonstration of top down design in our class. We first have the innit constructor method that builds the object and inputs the initial properties into the object instance. We then have a method add_to_cart that modifies the properties of the object.\n",
    "5. Functional programming: No. Since we are using OOP, there is no functional programming. Another way to look at it is we are also mutating properties of the object but functional programming emphasizes immutability, hence this is violated."

    "\n",
    "Your boss comes to you Monday morning and says “I figured out our next step; we are going to pivot from an online craft store and become a data center for genetic disease information! I found **ClinVar** which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gene name\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutation ID number\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Mutation value (reference & alternate bases)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Clinical significance (CLNSIG)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Disease that is implicated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The deliverables are the final result as a dataframe with a short discussion of any specifics. (that is, what data you would present to your boss with the explanation of your results)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use the instructor-modified \"clinvar_final.txt\" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing This file was modified to be not exactly the same as 'standard' .vcf file to test your data parsing skills. **This is a large file so do NOT upload it into your github repo!**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Replace missing values in the dataframe with: 'Not_Given'. Print or display this (including the Not_Given count) for the column `CLNSIG` by using pandas value_counts() function (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) State in your answer how you define harmful mutations\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Do your best on getting to above requirements and submit whatever you do before the deadline. If your work is incomplete be sure to describe the blockers that got in your way and how you might get past them (if given more time).**\n",
    "\n",
    "7) You can use as many code blocks as you need. Please clean-up your code and make it readable for the graders!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints** \n",
    "* We do not expect you to have any medical knowledge to solve this problem; look at the data, read the documentation provided, and write down your assumptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct pseudocode will give you partial credit so start with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Map out which fields you want to extract: Are they in the same place every time? What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas and NumPy parsers correctly recognize the end of each line in in the ClinVar file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work. You can answer the question with the information provided below or using the (partial) data dictionary file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lx9yHdlcqmU_OlHiTUXKC_LQDqYBypH_/view?usp=sharing. Our goal is to see that you can put together a sensible plan, implement a solid parsing strategy, and document and justify the decisions that you made."

    "To determine whether a mutation is harmful, we need to examine which variables could give an indication whether the mutation is dangerous. Upon looking at variables that offer a bit more qualitative information, we can infer the most relevant ones are Clinical Significance and Disease name implicated by the mutation. This was done through a value_counts to build intuition about the data. We can see that the mutation is classified as either Likely benign, benign, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. These are the four most relevant categories for this variable."

    "I took two approaches to answer address this question. The first was to look at the top 100 genes that had the highest proportions of being pathogenic with their mutations. This was done by grouping the genes together and determine the proportion of pathogenic mutations relative to total clinical significance including those that were benign. Some of the genes that were most susceptible to forming dangerous combinations with other mutations were AGXT:189, AHDC:27245, AMT:275, BCHE:590, and BTD:686. All their combinations with any one mutation were either pathogenic or likely pathogenic.\n",

    "The next approach was the more direct approach where I only showed the gene and mutation combinations that gave pathogenic or likely pathogenic clinical significance. This gave a total of 19,436 combinations that were dangerous or likely dangerous."
